# RPLidar.NET

This a .NET Standard 2.0 library written in C# to interface with Slamtech RPLidar. Tested with model A1 only.

I took Python RPLidar implementation as a reference:
https://github.com/SkoltechRobotics/rplidar

At the moment it supports commands:
 - Get info
 - Get health
 - Get configuration
 - Start legacy scan 
 - Stop scan
 - Reset
 
Work in progress on express (legacy and extended) scans.
